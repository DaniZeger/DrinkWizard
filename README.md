# Welcome to Drink Wizard

## About this project
"Drink Wizard" is an exciting cocktail exploration app that I had the privilege to develop during my journey as a full-stack student. This project has been a labor of love, combining my passion for technology and mixology.

### `Starting App`

When starting the `server side` using "npm start" you will see that there is some first initial data that will be send to the database, this case you can use the app and check it by yourself as admin using these details:

`email: dani@gmail.com` \
`password: 12345678` (this is the password off all users)

### `General information about project`
Using React as the core framework, I brought to life a dynamic platform where cocktail enthusiasts can discover, create, and enjoy a wide array of cocktail recipes. With a clean and intuitive user interface crafted with Bootstrap, React MUI, and SCSS, "Drink Wizard" offers an engaging and immersive experience for users.
