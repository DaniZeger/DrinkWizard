## About this project
"Drink Wizard" is an exciting cocktail exploration app that I had the privilege to develop during my journey as a full-stack student. This project has been a labor of love, combining my passion for technology and mixology.

### `General information about project`
Using React as the core framework, I brought to life a dynamic platform where cocktail enthusiasts can discover, create, and enjoy a wide array of cocktail recipes. With a clean and intuitive user interface crafted with Bootstrap, React MUI, and SCSS, "Drink Wizard" offers an engaging and immersive experience for users.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DaniZeger/DrinkWizard.git
```

2. Navigate to the project's main directory:
```bash
cd DrinkWizard
```

3. Install dependencies for both the client and server:
```bash
npm run install:all
```

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
After tha app is starting you'll see that there is some first initial data that will be sent to the MongoDB database, this will help you to check the app using two users:

When starting the `server side` using "npm start" you will see that there is some first initial data that will be send to the database, this case you can use the app and check it by yourself as admin using these details:

- For **admin** user use: \
`email: dani@gmail.com` \
`password: 12345678`

- For **regular** user use: \
`email: lee@gmail.com` \
`password: 12345678`

_** You can also create your own user using the "sign up" button_
